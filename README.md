# chrome-vite-svelte-ts-sass-boilerplate

This boilerplate can be useful if you start developing a Chrome extension that uses TypeScript globally, Svelte for the front-end and Sass for styling.
It is powered by Vite and @crxjs/vite-plugin, which ensures fast development and automatically reloads scripts for you.

## Get Started

You can use any package manager you want, I personally use `pnpm`.

### Install dependencies

```
pnpm install
```

### Development

Start a local development server which automatically reloads scripts and front-end.

```
pnpm dev
```

### Production

Build a production-ready extension

```
pnpm build
```

### Optional

Check your code for error

```
pnpm check
```

Prettify your project

```
pnpm prettier
```
